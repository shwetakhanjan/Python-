This program is the client end or the user layer of a GUI application to display xy plot with the help of Tkinter. 
A country name is chosen by the user and is sent across to the server side. A json string of data is returned by the server or the 
business layer. The json string is converted back to python string and processed further to plot an xy graph 
using MatPlotlib.

This file is the frontend, which interacts with the user and asks for a choice of a country name and displays its
data in form of graph(xy plot).
