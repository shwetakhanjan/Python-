This program is an example of OOP where there are two files,FrontEnd.py and BackEnd.py. FrontEnd.py contains Printdata class. It imports Data class from BackEnd.py 
to print data for yearly values of Co2 emission levels for every month of the years 1951 through 2019 and average temperature data for the same.
This file contains methods for printing  the data,for average CO2 emission levels stored in a dictionary,using a named tuple. This file interacts with the user.
  
This program is an example of OOP where there are two files, BackEnd.py, which contains Data class which reads different files, 'Co2.html' containing 
yearly values of Co2 emossion levels for every month of the years 1951 through 2019, and another file 'Temperature.html' that contains 
average temperature data for the years 1850 through 2018.
This file contains methods for reading the data,storing the temperature values in a default dictionary, average CO2 emission levels in a named tuple and 
yearly data in a default dictionary with year,temp and CO2 values. It also contains a method for a generator to yield the yearly values. 
This file does not interact with the user.
